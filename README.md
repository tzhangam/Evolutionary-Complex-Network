# Evolutionary-Complex-Network
The complex network project describing the network evolution from a singularity. 

It can be used to describe the process of a tribe growing to an empire, or the establishment of communication between interstellar civilizations.

Back in the day time, I received the complex network forum sent to me by professor szeto, and I had a look at the paper list of complex network 2017. It disappointed me just a little bit, that the theory part I was not confident that I am able to accomplish something now, at least I am not experienced how far can I go. And other topics are almost all focusing of studying existing networks, such as social network, logistics, etc, which are too common to be interersting and too practical to be simple enough, and the results, pathetically, I do not think will be inspiring and long lasting enough, most importantly not solid enough to be meaningful. Modelling problem has the same issue as well, although it should be the most important and interesting topic in this area, simulating human brains and all. 

My interest is in evolving networks, networks that starts from a singularity, evolves and grows, and communicates. With a embedded landscape, I might be able to simulate the evolution of a primitive tribe into an empire, or the contact between intestellar civilizations. I am good at writing simulations now, and computational science is all about simulation. Still to explore in this direction, I need theoretical backbones as support, and I am not worrying about writing simulation programs at all. One possible learning area is to use Python library to support my simulation, I have heard that SciPy has functionalities on this area. So hurray a task! I might start to work on complexnetwork now. I recalled that I saw a poster in UWaterloo MC building, that Einstein said he would spend 55 minutes thinking about a problem, and 5 minutes to get the solution, so understanding is much more important than anything else, first and formost!
